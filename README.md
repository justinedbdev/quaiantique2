## Utilisation

To create my project, I used Symfony CLI with the -webapp option in order to have a global project base, containing all the tools made available by Symfony, in particular Composer, Doctrine, Profiler and Mailer. I installed and used the EasyAdmin bundle to create my administration interface and Maildev to manage sending and receiving emails in development mode.

To connect the database, this can be found in the .env file. You must add the data relating to BDD and your RDBMS in the DATABASE_URL.

```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:3306/DBNAME?serverVersion=10.6.11-MariaDB"
```

Use this command to start a local server :

```
$ symfony serve
```
